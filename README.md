# NODE
Capstone project: NODE

In the realm of code and commits so stark,
GitHub echoes in the coder's park.
Bukowski's spirit in the pull request,
A digital realm, where bugs infest.

In the push and pull of lines of code,
A dance of pixels in the developer's abode.
Commits like verses in a code poet's rhyme,
GitHub, a stage for the coding paradigm.

Pulling from branches, merging in strife,
Conflict resolution, the coder's life.
Issues opened, discussions unfold,
A cybernated story, of bugs untold.

So, here's to GitHub, a poet's muse,
In the programming world, where wizards choose.
A versioned saga, in repositories deep,
Bukowski's spirit, in every line you keep.
